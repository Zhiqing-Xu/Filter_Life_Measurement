# Filter_Life_Measurement
Estimating the remaining life of three types of aircraft system filters. 

In this work, we, a team of five engineering students, collaborated to develop an innovative solution for Bombardier Aerospace. The task at hand was to design a system capable of estimating the remaining life of three types of aircraft system filters. This issue had previously led to inefficient usage of partially used filters.

The system we developed measures pressure drop across these filters under specific testing conditions (temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate). We employed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis to validate the design. Alongside this, we conducted a comprehensive safety analysis, economic evaluation, and formulated a construction plan, all of which were detailed in our final report. Based on the analysis, we designed custom-made adapters for installing the filters, reviewed and selected the control equipment, and finalized the pressure drop measuring system (shown by the piping and instrumentation diagram below).

To visually articulate our design and improve the design of the prototpye, we created 3D models for each part of the system using Autodesk Inventor. The 3D model aided us in identifying design flaws and facilitating necessary modifications, which is shown in the figures below.

After completing the design, we undertook rigorous testing and evaluation, focusing on the system's reliability, performance, and usability. We performed a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis to assess the design performance, leading to further design improvements. See figure below for the Particle tracing diagram from the CFD analysis.
