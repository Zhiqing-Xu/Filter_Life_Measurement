# Filter_Life_Measurement
Estimating the remaining life of three types of aircraft system filters. 

In this work, we, a team of five engineering students, collaborated to develop an innovative solution for Bombardier Aerospace. The task at hand was to design a system capable of estimating the remaining life of three types of aircraft system filters. This issue had previously led to inefficient usage of partially used filters.

The system we developed measures pressure drop across these filters under specific testing conditions (temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate). We employed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis to validate the design. Alongside this, we conducted a comprehensive safety analysis, economic evaluation, and formulated a construction plan, all of which were detailed in our final report.

Our design process began with a clear scope and problem definition. Based on our individual expertise, we effectively divided tasks. We designed custom-made adapters for installing the filters, reviewed and selected the control equipment, and designed the pressure drop measuring system.

To visually articulate our design, we created a 3D scale model of the system using Autodesk Inventor. This model significantly aided us in identifying design flaws and facilitating necessary modifications. It also served as a visual aid during presentations to our supervisor and client.

After completing the design, we undertook rigorous testing and evaluation, focusing on the system's reliability, performance, and usability. We performed a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis to assess the design performance, leading to further design improvements.

The culmination of our project was a 60-page report submitted to Bombardier Aerospace, detailing the final design and analyses from various engineering perspectives. We also built a prototype based on our final design for the project showcase.
