# Filter Life Measurement
Estimating the remaining life of three types of aircraft system filters. 


## Introduction
In collaboration with Bombardier Aerospace, our team, composed of five engineering student, dedicated our collective expertise to developing a robust, reliable solution to a long-standing challenge: the premature and inefficient replacement of partially used filters.

Our solution hinges on the measurement of pressure drop across three types of aircraft system filters under specific operational conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate. To validate the efficacy of our design, we conducted a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis, assessing not only the technical performance but also the safety implications, economic viability, and a strategic construction plan. The culmination of these efforts was encapsulated in a comprehensive report delivered to Bombardier Aerospace.

The engineering process encompassed the design of custom-made adapters for filter installation, a review and selection of control equipment, and the finalization of a system dedicated to the measurement of pressure drop. The final design, demonstrated in the above Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID), embodies our commitment to precision and functionality.

To better visualize and refine our design, we leveraged Autodesk Inventor to create 3D models for each component of the system. These models proved instrumental in identifying potential design flaws and facilitating necessary modifications.

Upon completion of the design phase, we undertook a evaluation and testing process, with a focused assessment on the system's reliability, performance, and usability. The implementation of a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis provided critical insights into the performance of our design, ultimately leading to a series of further design enhancements.

This project exemplifies our commitment to technical excellence, innovative thinking, and the relentless pursuit of efficient, effective solutions to the challenges faced by our industry. Through our concerted efforts, we were able to deliver a solution that promises to significantly improve the operational lifespan and utilization of aircraft system filters.
